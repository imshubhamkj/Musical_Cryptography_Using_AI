# Musical_Cryptography_Using_AI
A safe and secure way to encrypt and encode message in AI generated music. 

Instructions for running:

1. Install the required libraries
2. Run init.py 



Steps in the algorithm:

1) Plain text is converted to plain text using AES Encryption algorithm.

2) Genetic Algorithm is used to generate a musical piece by evolving itself . The main objective of using Genetic Algorithm is to generate a good music which is less prone to doubts from the attacker.
